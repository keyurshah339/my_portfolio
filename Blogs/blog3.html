                    Continuing our focus on some of the planetâ€™s least explored locations, today we venture to the heart
                    of the Amazon Rainforest. Despite constant media attention on the various environmental and cultural
                    issues related to the area, there are still vast regions which remain undocumented from a scientific
                    perspective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Representing over half of the remaining rainforest on Earth, the Amazon covers an unimaginable area
                    of approximately 2.5 million square miles. Little wonder then that certain parts of this incredible
                    ecosystem have so far eluded scientific study.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The statistics on what has already been discovered here are quite unbelievable: it is home to 1 in
                    10 of the total number of species on Earth including about 500 mammalian species, 40,000 plant
                    species, 3,000 freshwater fish species and over 370 reptile species. Being home to such a rich
                    biodiversity, there are bound to be many species which, as yet, are unknown to modern science. A
                    recent expedition into a previously unexplored and undocumented region in the Brazilian Amazon has
                    found exactly this.
