                    Thousands of people are expected to travel to desert towns in Nevada this weekend, inspired by a
                    viral call to “storm Area 51” in hopes of overpowering the US military and uncovering whatever
                    government secrets might be hiding there.</p>

                <p>
                    The desert base, which is entirely off-limits to civilians, has long been at the center of a
                    conspiracy among alien fans and ufologists — people who hunt for UFOs. Somewhere amid Area 51’s vast
                    desert acreage, they believe, is a heavily guarded underground lab where the government keeps and
                    studies captured alien aircraft — and possibly even aliens themselves. This belief that Area 51’s
                    “military base” is a cover for alien research has been fully mythologized by pop culture over the
                    years, becoming an entrenched part of alien lore.

                <p>
                    But those who arrive hoping to find parked flying saucers and green alien bodies laid out on cold
                    metal tables will surely be disappointed, for two reasons. The first is that local authorities
                    surely won’t let anyone near the secretive site in Nevada.

                 <h2><strong>Area 51 is the “birthplace of overhead espionage”</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    The first thing to know about Area 51 is that it’s big. Located 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas,
                    it’s contained within the Air Force-operated Nevada Test and Training Range — a huge,
                    government-controlled piece of land (“the largest contiguous air and ground space available for
                    peacetime military operations in the free world,” according to the NTTR itself) that’s roughly the
                    size of Connecticut.

                      There is very little there, not much more than desert far away from modern conveniences like cell
                    reception. That is by design: In 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower asked for a secret location in
                    which to start a high-altitude reconnaissance program. Two CIA staffers embarked on an expedition to
                    find a remote, secret location in which to test new spy planes that could see into the Soviet
                    Union’s burgeoning nuclear weapons program. They soon found what they were looking for.
